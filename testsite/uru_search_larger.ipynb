      "Ghana's startup ecosystem funding growth over the last four years has shown promising developments. Local players have emerged as key alternatives to bridge the access to capital gap, especially in the face of a global venture capital market slowdown. Various interventions and initiatives have been introduced to provide capital to companies, such as the World Bank-funded Ghana Economic Transformation Project, which recapitalized the Venture Capital Trust Fund with $40 million. Additionally, the creation of fund-of-fund vehicles like the Startup Catalyst Fund and Strategic Industries Fund has significantly contributed to increasing the capital pool available to SMEs in Ghana. Moreover, youth-led investment vehicles like Moonshot Venture Partners and Boxplay Ventures have played a crucial role in bridging the financing gap. These efforts have not only addressed the challenges faced by startups in accessing capital but have also paved the way for a more robust and supportive funding environment within Ghana's startup ecosystem.\n",
